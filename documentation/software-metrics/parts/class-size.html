:Description:  This article describes the CSZ - Class Size metric as it is defined
               in the literature and how it is implemented in PHP_Depend. Later in
               this article we describe the impact of the class size on several
               quality-factors in a software system.
:Keywords:     CSZ, CS, Class Size, Khaled et al., Optimal Class Size, SRP, Single Responsibility Principle, testability, responsibility, maintainability</p>
<p>The <em>Class Size</em> or <em>CSZ</em> metric is a another measure for the complexity and
size of a class. In many publications and books this metric is frequently
referenced with the abbreviation <em>CS</em>. The definition and detailed description
of this metric can be found in <em>The Optimal Class Size for Object-Oriented<br />Software</em> paper by Khaled, Benlarbi, Nishith &amp; Shesh [#ooocsz]_.</p>
<p>There are three different definitions of the <em>Class Size</em> metric, two of them
are only a different name for already existing metrics. The first one takes the
number of statements, respectively the <em>Logical Lines Of Code</em> (<em>LLOC</em>), to
measure the size of class. The second variant uses the <em>Lines Of Code</em> (<em>LOC</em>)
as an indicator for the class size.</p>
<p>The third variant uses two language constructs of object-oriented programming
languages to measure the size of class and calculates the sum of both values.
These to language constructs are methods and attributes, so that the existing
metrics <em>Number Of Methods</em> (<em>NOM</em>) and <em>Number Of Attributes</em> (<em>VARS</em>) can<br />be reused to calculate the <em>Class Size</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>CSZ = NOM + VARS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>PHP_Depend implements this third variant of <em>Class Size</em> metric algorithm to
measure the size of a class.</p>
<p>As several researches and studies on procedural software projects have shown,
the optimal size of a software component, lies somewhere between too small
and too large, to be less fault-prone. This model can be visualized with an
u-curve, where the lower arc of the U represents the optimal size of a
component. But this model does not apply to object-oriented software systems,
as Khaled et al. have shown in their paper [#ooocsz]_. Object-oriented systems
tend to be more fault-prone when they get bigger and less fault-prone when
they use small classes and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
[#poodsrp]_.</p>
<p>For the <em>CSZ</em> metric this means that smaller values are always better, than
greater ones, because a smaller size is an indicator for better testability,
good maintainability and a well defined responsibility of the class.</p>
<a id="thresholds"></a>
<h3>Thresholds</h3>
<p>Based on their research of several software systems and their reflection of
other studies about the optimal size of a software component Khaled et al.
suggest an upper limit 39 for a <em>Class Size</em> metric based on the number of
a class' methods and attributes. But as always, this threshold can only be
a clue for own limits, that fit to custom requirements.</p>
