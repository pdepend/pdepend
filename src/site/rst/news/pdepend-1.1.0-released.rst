:Keywords:     Release, Version, Trait, bugfixes

We are proud to announce that version `1.1.0`__ of PHP_Depend was released
on September the 12th 2012. This release closes a critical issue in the context
of traits handling.

With this release we make `composer`__ a first citizen distribution channel of
PHP_Depend, just add PHP_Depend as a dependency to your ``composer.json`` ::

  {
      "require": {
          "pdepend/pdepend": "1.1.0"
      }
  }

Then install Composer in your project (or `download the composer.phar`__
directly): ::

  ~ $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

And finally let Composer install the project dependencies: ::

  ~ $ php composer.phar install

Download
